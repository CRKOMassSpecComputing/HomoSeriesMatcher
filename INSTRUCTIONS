The following document describes the steps necessary to run
“HomoSeriesMatcher” to identify homologous series in high resolution mass
spectrometry data. The process is divided into 3 R scripts that should run in
numerical order as identified in the file name. 


Step1_Identify_homologous_series.R 
This script builds off of Martin Loos’ “nontarget” package
found on GitHub. Homologous series are identified in each sample. 
 

Step2_Filtering_out_crossmeshed_and_duplicate_series
This script filters out crossmeshed and duplicate series for
each sample. 


Step3_Temporal_Series_Generation
